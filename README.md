# Project-1: YouTube Data Collection and Storage

## Introduction

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project provides users with the capability to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. This project leverages SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit to create a user-friendly application that enables users to retrieve, store, and query YouTube channel and video data efficiently.

## Project Overview

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project encompasses the following key components:

- **Streamlit Application:** An intuitive user interface powered by the Streamlit library that allows users to interact with the application for data retrieval and analysis tasks.

- **YouTube API Integration:** Seamless integration with the YouTube API for fetching channel and video data based on the provided channel ID.

- **MongoDB Data Lake:** Storing the retrieved data in a MongoDB database, providing a flexible and scalable solution for handling unstructured and semi-structured data.

- **SQL Data Warehouse:** Transferring data from the data lake to a SQL database, enabling efficient querying and analysis using SQL queries.

- **Data Visualization:** Presentation of the retrieved data utilizing Streamlit's data visualization features, empowering users to analyze data through visually appealing charts and graphs.

## Technologies Used

This project relies on the following technologies:

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing the application and scripting tasks.

- **Streamlit:** A Python library employed to create interactive web applications and dynamic data visualizations.

- **YouTube API:** Google API used for retrieving channel and video data directly from YouTube.

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database utilized as a data lake for storing the retrieved YouTube data.

- **SQL (MySQL):** A relational database serving as a data warehouse for storing and efficiently managing the migrated YouTube data.

- **SQLAlchemy:** A Python library utilized for seamless SQL database connectivity and interaction.

- **Pandas:** A powerful data manipulation library employed for data processing and in-depth analysis.

- **Matplotlib:** A data visualization library employed for crafting insightful charts and graphs.
